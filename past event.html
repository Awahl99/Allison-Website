			<h2 class="text-center">Traveling Has Changed My Life</h2>
			  <p>I’ve been traveling since I was little. I remember going on road trips with my grandma and grandpa at a young age. I remember being in the car and telling my grandpa when we would pass a McDonald’s. Like most five years old’s I craved McDonald’s and begged my grandpa to get off the exit so we could go. My grandma still tells people that every time we would pass a McDonald’s I would say “grandpa you passed another one!” Not only did I learn where every McDonald’s was from Illinois to Kentucky, I learned how to appreciate traveling and fall in love with the feeling of being somewhere I have never been.</p> 
			  <p>Since traveling as a little girl with my grandparents I have embarrassed my love for traveling. The first big trip I took without my family was to Disney World in Florida with my high school peers During my high school career, I was in a marching band called Marching 100. The Marching 100 takes a big trip every four years. That year happened to be my freshman year of high school and we got to march in the parade at Magic Kingdom Park. This trip was one I will never forget; I was on a charter bus for 24 hours. On the way down to Florida, there was a snowstorm and we had to go around Tennessee, which set the itinerary back one whole day. I remember waking up at the rest stop, wondering where we were, and I saw the trumpet players having a snowball fight in the snow that went up to their knees. The band made it safely to Disney World, I remember the next five days went by super-fast. I had the best time with my band member peers at Disney World. I will never forget marching in the parade while it was raining so hard that I couldn’t see in front of my face. Overall, the trip was amazing, some of the moments I made in Disney World I will cherish forever</p>

			  <p>Having a rough start to a trip is normal for me. I had dreamed of going to Hawaii since high school and that dream came true in 2018. When I flew to Hawaii our first flight was canceled, then rebooked in a matter of 20 minutes. I had been looking forward to this trip for four years and I was not going to let anything get in the way of this trip. After sweating, fighting with the flight receptionist, and crying we finally got settled on the plane. An hour before landing in LA the flight attendant told me “If you want to catch the flight to Hawaii you are going to have to run as fast as you can to that terminal!” That is exactly what I did, I ran as fast as possible, and we were the last ones to go get to the plane. As soon as we landed in Hawaii, I knew it was worth running through LAX. Hawaii is so breathtaking; words cannot describe how beautiful it was.</p>
