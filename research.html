			<h2 class="text-center">Toxic Chemicals In Our Everyday Products</h2>
			  <p>The average person uses eight to ten beauty products daily, women on
avenge use eleven to fifteen, and men use six different products every day. 
When reaching for a product to clean your hair and body, people gravitate 
towards a vibrant bottle that displays cleanliness. Most people do not read 
what is on the back of the bottle. According to survey research, one in three 
people never checks cosmetic ingredients. The words are the back of these 
beauty products are hard to pronounce. If someone cannot pronounce the 
word, then they probably don’t know what that ingredient is or what its use 
is. Not knowing what is on the label listing and putting it onto your skin and 
hair is very harmful to the organ system, everyday health, and much more.</p>  
			  <img src="./images/cosmetic.jpg" alt="hidden chemicals" width="45%" class="mr-3">
			  <p>Americans in the United States are exposed to tons of chemicals daily, 
these chemical ingredients are the bases of everyday products. According to 
the Environmental Working Group, industrial chemicals are basic ingredients 
in personal care products. The 12,500 unique chemical ingredients in these 
products equate to about one of every seven of the 82,000 chemicals 
registered for use in the U.S. Personal care products contain carcinogens, 
pesticides, reproductive toxins, endocrine disruptors, plasticizers, 
degreasers, and surfactants.</p> 
			  <p>According to research having been exposed to these chemicals over a 
long period of time can cause many health issues. Exposure starts at a 
young age because these chemicals can be found in baby shampoo, soap, 
and lotions. As a country, the United States has not set a ban on any 
chemical ingredients. These ingredients are being put in cosmetic products 
and infant care. We are the only country as a whole that has not put a ban or
stop to this. Slowly individual states are passing regulations for the everyday
products that are being used. California was the first state to pass a law 
protecting its residents from harmful chemicals in cosmetic products. The 
recent California Toxic-Free Cosmetic Act (AB 2762 – Muratsuchi,) is to 
ban 24 of the most toxic chemicals on the planet from beauty and personal 
care products sold in California. Signed into law by Governor Newsom on 
September 30, 2020, the law will go into effect in 2025.</p>  
			  <img src="./images/ing in products.webp" alt="Ingredients" width="45%" class="mr-3">
			  <p>The press release for California Toxic-Free Cosmetic Act is attached below, 
this bill was introduced by Assemblymembers Al Muratsuchi (Torrance), Bill 
Quirk (Hayward) and Buffy Wicks (Oakland) and is supported by dozens of 
NGOs and safe cosmetics companies. After the bill was established many 
popular store brands including Target, Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS Health 
plan to ban the list of toxic chemicals above from any of their products 
distributed. One store that has already banned the toxic chemical 
formaldehyde from its products sold is Whole Foods.</p>

			  <p>Since the 1930s the FDA has been regulating the cosmetic industry, but 
there have been no set guidelines manufacturers have to follow. As stated 
by the FDA, “The law does not require cosmetic products and ingredients, 
other than color additives, to have FDA approval before they go on the 
market.” The FDA has tricked many Americans into thinking cosmetic 
products have been regulated and protected against harmful chemicals.A survey done by registered nurse Karen Selby showed that trust has led 55% of female respondents to wrongly assume that the FDA organization regulates makeup ingredients. And 59% of men made the same mistaken assumption. Cosmetic manufacturers do not have to share product formulas or register with the FDA. These manufacturers are left to regulate themselves. Billions of products are on the shelves at local stores right now without any regulations. Everyone should be aware of this and be conscience when picking out household items.</p> 
			  <p>There are ways you can spot harmful makeup and cosmetic items. Remember the list above and look for those chemicals in the ingredients list. Understanding your labels is most important. You can find clean and nonharmful products by looking for “free” labels, don’t always trust organic or natural labels, do not buy anything with the ingredient fragrance, and do your own research.</p>
